## 16. Verification Commands

To verify this repository is clean:

```bash
# 1. Check for secrets
grep -rE "(password|secret|key|token|api).*=.*['\"]" config/ app/ --exclude-dir={tmp,log} | grep -v "demo\|example\|your-"

# 2. Check for real emails
grep -rE "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@(?!demo\.com|example\.com)[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}" . --exclude-dir={node_modules,tmp,log,vendor}

# 3. Check for IP addresses
grep -rE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" config/ | grep -v "127.0.0.1\|0.0.0.0\|your-server-ip"

# 4. Check database for real data
rails runner "puts User.pluck(:email_address).grep_v(/@demo\.com/)"

# 5. Verify demo mode
rails runner "puts DemoStubs::MessagingService.demo_mode?"
```

Expected results: No secrets, no real emails, no real IPs, only demo users, demo mode enabled.
