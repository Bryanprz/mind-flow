  <h5 class="px-2 text-sm font-semibold mt-2">Unbalanced Kapha</h5>
  <p class="text-base px-2">
    When Kapha is out of balance, its heavy and dense nature can manifest physically as obesity, sluggishness, and stagnation, or conversely, as weak bones and low endurance. Energetically, you might experience a lack of movement, inertia, and stuck prana, or scattered and inconsistent energy.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base px-2">
    Mentally and emotionally, an imbalanced Kapha often leads to stubbornness, dullness, and depression. Alternatively, it can result in instability, indecisiveness, and insecurity. Your intuition might become over-grounded rounded-xl and difficulty accessing subtle realms, or conversely, lead to disorientation and unstable intuitive connection.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base px-2">
    At the deepest level, an unbalanced Kapha can cause bliss veiled by density and attachment, or emptiness and a disconnection from the embodiment of bliss.
