1,,"We shall now expound “The Pathology of the Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)”","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
2,,"Thus declared the worshipful Atreya.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
3,"The Number of the Urinary Disorders","Classified according to the provocation of the three humors, there are twenty disorders of the urinary secretion; while there are innumerable conditions where urine is affected secondarily. We shall now expound urinary disorders resulting from the provocation of the three humors.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
4,"Their pathology","Here we shall describe the suppression or the incidence of the disease which occurs as a result of the variations in the etiological factors, intensity of morbid humors and susceptibility of the body-elements.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
4,"Their pathology","If these three factors, mainly the etiological factors etc., do not mutually associate or support, or if they do so after a long lapse of time, or in a very mild form, either there occurs no manifestation of the disease at all or the disease takes a long period to evolve, or appears in an ambulatory or abortive form. Under the contrary conditions, there occur contrary results. Thus are laid down the different causes of the modes of incidence or suppression of all diseases.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
5,"Their pathology","These three special pathological conditions cause the rapid manifestation of the anomalies of urinary secretion (prameha) born of Kapha.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
5,"Their pathology","They are the frequent and excessive use of new rice (Hayānaka hāyanaka), Yavaka, Cinaka cīnaka, Uddalaka uddālaka, Naishadha naiṣadha, Itkata itkaṭa, Mukundaka, Mahavrihi mahāvrīhi, Pramodaka, and Sugnndhaka grains.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
5,"Their pathology","Similarly the use of new peas, black-gram and other pulses along with ghee, of the flesh of domestic, wetland and aquatic animals, of vegetables, til, til-paste, flour, milk-pudding, kedgeree, thick gruel and the preparations of sugarcane juice, or the frequent use of milk, fresh wine, unformed curds, or liquid, sweet and unripe articles.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
5,"Their pathology","Avoidance of cleanliness and exercise, indulgence in sleeping, lying and sedentary habits, and whatever other factors are likely to increase Kapha, fat and urine—these are all special etiological factors.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
6,"Their pathology","The special morbific factor of the humor is excessive fluidity of Kapha (body-colloid).","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
7,"Their pathology","The special features of susceptible body-elements are these—excessiveness and diminished viscousness of the adipose tissue, muscular tissue, body fluid, semen, blood, fat, marrow, lymph and the fluid which is called the vital essence.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
8,"The Kapha type of Disorders","When these three special pathological conditions occur simultaneously in the body, the kapha becomes suddenly provoked. It is the first to be provoked because it is already in excessive quantity. It being provoked quickly, spreads in the body owing to the flabbiness of the body. While circulating in the body, it first gets mixed with the adipose tissue, owing to pathological changes in the adipose tissue, viz., excessiveness and diminished viscousness and also owing to the great similarity of quality between the Kapha and the adipose tissue. Combining with the adipose tissue, the Kapha vitiates it because the Kapha is already vitiated. The vitiated Kapha by coupling with vitiated adipose tissue now comes in contact with body-fluid and muscular tissue owing to excessive increase of both of these in the body.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
8,"The Kapha type of Disorders","Owing to the vitiation of the muscular tissue, it causes putrefying and sloughing inflammatory swellings like Śarāvikā crateriform ulcer or carbuncle and such others occurring in this tissue on account of its morbific condition. Then further vitiating the body-fluid, it changes it into urine. Then reaching the orifices of the urinary channels from the kidneys and bladder which are dilated by the morbid fat and body-fluid, it then becomes localized there, and thus gives birth to the anomalies of urinary secretion (prameha). It gets firmly established within the system and may become incurable owing to occurrence of such pathological changes in the body.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
9,"The Kapha type of Disorders","The body-fluid combined with the Kapha and the adipose tissue while being converted into urine on its entrance into the kidneys, acquires the following ten pathological characteristics of Kapha: whiteness, coldness, hardness, viscousness, transparency, unctuousness, heaviness, sweetness, denseness, clearness and slowness. Then it acquires a special name accompanied with the qualities of one or more of the other conditions by which it has been mainly modified.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
10,"Their Names","Thus we have ten varieties of urinary disorders in accordance with their special designations. They are—Udakameha or Hydruria, Ikshuvalikarasameha or Glycosuria, Sandrameha or Chyluria, Sandraprasadameha or Belluria, Shuklameha or Bacteriuria, Shukrameha or Spermatuda, Shitameha or Phosphaturia, Sikatameha or Graveluria, Shanairmeha or Slow-micturition, and Alalameha or Pyuria.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
11,"Their Curability","These ten urinary disorders are curable due to their being seated in the adipose tissue which is of similar quality and also due to the predominance of Kapha and to the similarity in treatment.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
12,"The Ten Varieties of Kapha Type","The following are the verses regarding the special characteristics of urinary disorders of Kapha type.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
13,,"That person who passes urine that is clear, excessive in quantity, whitish, cool, odorless and watery owing to the provocation of Kapha, suffers from Hydruria.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
14,,"That person who passes urine which is exceedingly sweet, cool, slightly viscid, turbid and resembling the juice of sugarcane owing to the provocation of Kapha, suffers from Glycosuria.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
15,,"That person whose urine gets thickened if kept overnight in a vessel owing to the provocation of Kapha, suffers from Chyluria.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
16,,"That person, whose urine, if kept overnight in a vessel, becomes partly dense and partly clear owing to the provocation of Kapha, is said to be suffering from Belluria.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
17,,"That person whose urine is white and appears as if mixed with flour and who suffers from frequent micturition owing to the provocation of Kapha is said to be suffering from Bacteriuria.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
18,,"That person is said to be suffering from Spermaturia born of the provocation of Kapha, who frequently passes urine which is either semen-like in appearance or is mixed with semen.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
19,,"That person is said to be suffering from Phosphaturia born of the provocation of Kapha, who passes a large quantity of urine which is exceedingly sweet and cold.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
20,,"That person is to be known to suffer from Graveluria born of provoked Kapha, who passes along with urine, hard and small particles produced by the pathological condition of the urine.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,

22,,"That person is said to be suffering from Pyuria born of provoked Kapha, whose urine appears to be full of mucous threads and is slimy and viscid.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
23,,"Thus, the ten anomalies of urinary secretion (prameha) caused by the provocation of Kapha, have been described.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
24,"The Pitta type of Disorders","In a man afflicted already with the above mentioned condition, the habitual use of hot, acid, salt, alkaline and pungent articles, predigestion-meal, and exposure to severe sunshine and fire, anxiety, overwork, anger and promiscuous diet cause immediate provocation of Pitta. This provoked Pitta, very soon, brings about the manifestation of the following six kinds of the urinary anomalies (prameha) by the same process as described above.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
25,"Their Names","These again acquire special designation according to the particular qualities of Pitta. They are—Ksharameha, Kalameha, Nilameha, Lohitameha, Manjishthameha and Haridrameha.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
26,"Their Names","They combine with the six qualities of Pitta as described above viz., alkaline quality, acidity, saltishness, pungency, smell of raw meat and heat.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
27,"Their Palliable nature","They are all only palliable owing to the proximity of the seat of the discordant humors, and that of the adipose tissue and owing to the antagonism involved in their treatment.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
28,"The signs and symptoms of Pitta type of disorders","Here are the following verses regarding the special characteristics of the urinary disorders of Pitta type.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,

30,,"That person is said to be suffering from Kalameha (Melanuria), born of the excessive provocation of Pitta, who passes soot-black and warm urine constantly.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
31,,"That person is said to be suffering from Nilameha (Indigouria), born of the excessive provocation of Pitta, who passes urine of the color of the wings of blue Jay (Cāṣa) bird and which is acid.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
32,,"That person is said to be suffering from Lohitameha (Hematuria), born of the excessive provocation of Pitta whose urine smells like raw meat and which is saltish, warm and red.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
33,,"That man is said to be suffering from Manjishthameha (Hemoglobinuria) born of the provocation of Pitta, who passes urine of the color of indian madder water, which is increased in quantity, and which smells like raw meat.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
34,,"That person is said to be suffering from Haridrameha (Urobiliuria) born of the provocation of Pitta, whose urine is of the color of turmeric-water, and is pungent.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
35,,"Thus have been described the six anomalies of urinary secretion (prameha) caused by the excessive provocation of Pitta.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
36,"The Vata type of Disorders","In a man afflicted with the above mentioned condition, the habitual use of astringent, pungent, bitter, dry, light and cold articles and over-indulgence in sex-act, exercise, emesis, purgation, enemata and errhines, suppression of natural urges, fasting, trauma, sun-heat, worry, grief, depletion of blood, walking and unwholesome postures of the body, cause immediate provocation of Vata.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
37,"Their pathology","When the provoked Vata while circulating in such a body, carrying fat with it, goes to the urinary channels, there occurs the condition of Vasāmeha (Lipuria). When it carries marrow to the urinary organs, there occurs the condition of Majjameha (Myelo-uria). When it carries the lymph to the urinary organs and causes the continual flow of urine, then owing to excessiveness of lymph and the expelling quality of Vata, there occurs markedly frequent urge for micturition, and retention of the residual urine. In such a condition, the man continuously discharges urine without any force like a mad elephant; this condition is called Hastimeha. If Vata by its dry quality changes the vital essence which is naturally of sweet taste, into one of astringent taste and carries it to the urinary organs, then it causes the condition called Madhumeha (Diabetes).","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
38,"Their Etiology","Physicians consider these four types of urinary disorders caused by Vata as incurable owing to their great urgency and the antagonism involved in the treatment.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
39,"Their Names","They obtain special appellation according to the respective qualities of Vata. They are Lipuria, Myelo-uria, Hastimeha and Diabetes.","Anomalies of Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)",4,
